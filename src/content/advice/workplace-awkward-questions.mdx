Colleagues often lose their filter when a coworker is pregnant.

## "Are you coming back?"
This is the most common (and annoying) one.
*   **Response:** "My plan is absolutely to return. Right now I'm focused on finishing [Project] strong."
*   **Legally:** You are not required to disclose your long-term life plans, only your leave dates (check your local HR laws).

## "I guess you won't want that promotion now."
*   **Response:** "My ambition hasn't changed. I'm very interested in that role."

## "Enjoy the vacation!" (Referring to maternity leave)
*   **Response:** "It's definitely not a vacation! Recovering from a major medical event keeping a tin y human alive is hard work, but I'm looking forward to the bonding time."
