It starts usually in the second trimester. You're waiting in line for coffee, or at a family gathering, and suddenly—a hand is on your stomach.

It is invasive, it is awkward, and you have every right to hate it.

## Why it happens
People (usually) don't mean harm. They are excited about the baby and forget that the baby is inside *your* body. But their intent doesn't override your autonomy.

## Scripts that work

### For Strangers
The "Physical Block" is often the most effective. If you see a hand coming, simply place your own hand over your belly to block the landing zone.

If they make contact:
*   **Direct & Polite:** "Oh, I'm not comfortable with being touched. Thanks for understanding."
*   **The Pivot:** (Step back) "I'm just protecting my personal space today!"
*   **The Mirror (Riskier):** Reach out and touch their stomach. "We're doing this, right?" (Use with caution!)

### For Family
Family can be trickier because of the relationship dynamic.

*   "I know you're excited, but I'm feeling really sensitive about being touched right now. Please ask me first."
*   "My belly is a no-fly zone for now, but I'd love a high-five!"

## Setting the precedent
It helps to set expectations early. If you don't like it now, you might not want people passing the baby around without asking later. establishing these boundaries now is good practice for parenthood.
