"Has it started?" "Any news?" "How many centimeters?"

The phone blowing up during labor is a major distraction.

## The Strategy: The Point Person
Designate a text-captain (partner, doula, or trusted friend).
"We will be turning our phones off to focus. [Name] will send an update when there is news to share. No news = we are busy!"

## Scripts
*   "We want to be fully present, so we won't be replying to texts. We promise you'll know when the baby is here!"
*   "Please no 'labor watch' messages—they stress me out!"
