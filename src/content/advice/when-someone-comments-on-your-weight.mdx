"Wow, are you sure there's only one in there?"
"You look ready to pop!"
"You're so tiny, are you eating enough?"

Why do people think pregnancy turns your body into a topic for public debate?

## The Reality Check
You do not owe anyone an explanation about your size, your weight gain, or your bump shape. Your doctor is the only one whose opinion matters medically. Everyone else is just making noise.

## Scripts to shut it down

### The "Play Dumb"
*   "What do you mean by that?" (Watch them scramble to explain why they just called you huge).
*   "Oh, that's an interesting thing to say out loud."

### The Direct Approach
*   "My doctor says I'm right on track."
*   "I prefer not to discuss my body size. Let's talk about [Item], how is it?"

### The Humor Deflection
*   "Yep, huge. I'm actually smuggling a watermelon."
*   "I know! I am cultivating mass!"

## Remember
Comments about your size are almost always about the commenter's own perceptions, anxieties, or lack of filter. They are not a reflection of your health or your worth.
