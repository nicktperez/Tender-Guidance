You're just trying to buy diapers, and a stranger is telling you about their 48-hour labor and 4th-degree tear. Why?

## Why they do it
Birth is a transformative, intense event. Many people never fully processed theirs, so they dump it on the nearest pregnant person. It's not about you; it's about their need to be heard. But you are not their therapist.

### The Interruption
*   "Oh wow, that sounds intense! I'm actually in a really positive headspace about birth right now, so I'm going to stop you there."

### The Subject Change
*   "It sounds like you went through a lot. By the way, do you know where the pickles are?"

### The Honest Plea
*   "My anxiety is prett high right now, so I'm avoiding scary stories. Let's talk about the baby's nursery instead!"

## Protect your peace
Your mind is preparing for a major athletic event. You wouldn't tell a marathon runner about broken legs right before the race. It is okay to curate what you let into your brain.
