You mention you're planning for an epidural, and suddenly you get The Look. Or the comment: "Don't you want to experience the birth fully?"

## The Truth
There is no trophy for suffering. There is no "right" way to give birth. The goal is a healthy parent and a healthy baby.

## Scripts for the purists

### Short & Sweet
*   "I'm keeping my options open and doing what feels right for me."
*   "This is between me and my medical team."

### For the "Scare Tactic" stories
*   "I've done my research and I'm comfortable with my decision. I'd rather not hear horror stories right now."

### The "Experience" argument
*   "I plan to be very present! I just plan to be present with less pain."

## Confidence is key
You don't need to justify your pain management choices to anyone. If you say it with confidence ("I am getting an epidural."), people are less likely to argue than if you sound unsure ("I think I might...").
