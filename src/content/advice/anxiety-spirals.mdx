## The "What If" Game
When your brain says "What if [bad thing]?", try to answer with "What if [good thing]?"
*   "What if something is wrong?" -> "What if everything is actually okay?"

## Grounding
*   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.
*   **Cold Water:** Splash cold water on your face. It triggers the mammalian dive reflex and slows your heart rate.

## Information Diet
Stop Googling. Seriously. Google is an algorithm designed to keep you clicking, usually on scary stuff.
